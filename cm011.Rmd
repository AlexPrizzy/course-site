# cm011 - October 30, 2017

## Overview

* Define statistical learning
* Review the major goals of statistical learning
* Explain the difference between parametric and non-parametric methods
* Introduce linear models and ordinary least squares regression
* Demonstrate how to estimate a linear model in R using `lm()`
* Demonstrate how to extract model statistics using [`broom`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/index.html) and [`modelr`](https://github.com/hadley/modelr)
* Practice estimating linear models

## Before class

* Read chapters 22-25 in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Slides and links

* [Slides](extras/cm011_slides.html)
* [Statistical learning: the basics](stat001_statistical_learning.html)
* [Statistical learning: linear regression](stat002_linear_models.html)

* [Vignette on `broom`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html)
