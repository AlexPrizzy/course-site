# cm011 - October 30, 2017

## Overview

* Define statistical learning
* Review the major goals of statistical learning
* Explain the difference between parametric and non-parametric methods
* Introduce linear models and ordinary least squares regression
* Demonstrate how to estimate a linear model in R using `lm()`
* Demonstrate how to extract model statistics using [`broom`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/index.html) and [`modelr`](https://github.com/hadley/modelr)
* Practice estimating and interpreting linear models

## Before class

* Read chapters 22-25 in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* If you want a more rigorous introduction to the fundamentals of statistical learning and linear models, read chapters 2 and 3 in [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7). However this text assumes a much stronger knowledge of math, probability, and statistics.

## What you need to do

* Install the `titanic` package using the command `install.packages("titanic")`. We will be using this package in-class next time
