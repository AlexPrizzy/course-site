# cm012 - November 1, 2017

## Overview

* Demonstrate the use of logistic regression for classification
* Identify methods for assessing classification model accuracy
* Define a decision tree
* Demonstrate how to estimate a decision tree
* Define and estimate a random forest
* Introduce the `caret` package for statistical learning in R

## Before class

* Read chapters 4.1-3, 8.1, 8.2.2 in [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7) if you want a rigorous introduction to the mathematics behind logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. In class we will **briefly** summarize how these methods work and spend the bulk of our time on estimating and interpreting these models

* [The `caret` Package](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) - introductory book for the `caret` package. Tells you what models you can implement and all the nitty-gritty details to customize `train` for different cross-validation methods.
