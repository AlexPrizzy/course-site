# cm012 - November 1, 2017

## Overview

* Define a decision tree
* Demonstrate how to estimate a decision tree
* Define and estimate a random forest
* Introduce the `caret` package for statistical learning in R
* Define resampling methods
* Compare and contrast the validation set approach with leave-one-out and $k$-fold cross-validation
* Demonstrate how to conduct cross-validation using `modelr`

## Before class

* Read chapters , 8.1, 8.2.2, and 5.1 in [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7) if you want a rigorous introduction to the mathematics behind logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. In class we will **briefly** summarize how these methods work and spend the bulk of our time on estimating and interpreting these models
