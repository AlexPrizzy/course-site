<h1>Intro to Leaflet</h1>
<p><a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> is an open-source JavaScript library for creating interactive maps. Unlike static visualization packages such as <code>ggplot2</code> or <code>ggmap</code>, Leaflet maps are fully interactive and can include features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive panning/zooming</li>
<li>Pop-up tooltips and labels</li>
<li>Highlighting/selecting regions</li>
</ul>
<p>It is used by many news organizations and tech websites to visualize geographic data. The <code>leaflet</code> package for R enables the creation of interactive maps within R without learning how to write JavaScript code. The <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/"><code>leaflet</code> documentation</a> is a handy walkthrough for the basics of creating Leaflet maps in R. Let’s explore here how to create Leaflet maps using the same data we used to create <a href="geoviz_ggmap.html">raster maps with <code>ggmap</code></a>, <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2017/d62x-nvdr">crime data from the city of Chicago in 2017</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h1>Add markers</h1>
<p><strong>Markers</strong> are used to identify points on the map. Each point needs to be defined in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates. These can come from a variety of sources, most commonly either a <a href="geoviz_import_data.html">map data file</a> such as a shapefile or GeoJSON (imported using <code>sf</code>) or a data frame with latitude and longitude columns.</p>
<p>Let’s use the Chicago crimes data to draw a map of the city identifying the location of each reported homicide:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>addMarkers()</code> and related functions will automatically check data frames for columns called <code>lng</code>/<code>long</code>/<code>longitude</code> and <code>lat</code>/<code>latitude</code> (case-insensitively). If your coordinate columns have any other names, you need to explicitly identify them using the <code>lng</code> and <code>lat</code> arguments. Such as `addMarkers(lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without any customization, we get a basic map with each murder location indicated by a dropped pin. Each markers appearance can be customized, though the technical difficulty quickly ramps up. The <a href="https://github.com/lvoogdt/Leaflet.awesome-markers">awesome markers</a> plugin offers the most straight-forward customizability options. Instead of using <code>addMarkers()</code>, use <code>addAwesomeMarkers()</code> to control the appearance of the markers using icons from the <a href="http://fontawesome.io/icons/">Font Awesome</a>, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/components/">Bootstrap Glyphicons</a>, and <a href="http://ionicons.com/">Ion icons</a> icon libraries. First you define the appearance of the icon using <code>awesomeIcons()</code>, then pass that as an argument to <code>addAwesomeMarkers()</code>:</p>
