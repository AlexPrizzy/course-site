# cm014 - May 9, 2018

## Overview

* Introduce the major components of a geospatial visualization
* Identify how to draw raster maps using `ggmaps` and `get_map()`
* Define shapefiles and import spatial data using the `sf` package
* Draw maps using `ggplot2` and `geom_sf()`
* Change coordinate systems
* Generate appropriate color palettes to visualize additional dimensions of data
* Introduce interactive maps and the `leaflet` package

## Before class

* Read [Introduction to geospatial visualization](geoviz_intro.html)
* Read [Drawing raster maps with `ggmap`](geoviz_ggmap.html)
* Read [Importing shapefiles using `sf`](geoviz_import_data.html)
* Read [Drawing vector maps with `ggplot2` and `sf`](geoviz_plot.html)

## Slides and links

* [Slides](extras/cm014_slides.html)
* [Notes from class](dataviz_geospatial.html)

* [Working with Geospatial Data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-geospatial-data-in-r) - a DataCamp course which goes into more depth and practice than what we did here
* [Mapping data in *The Truthful Art* by Alberto Cairo](http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/databases-and-reporting-tools/9780133440492/part-iii-functional/ch10_html) - excellent chapter on designing data maps with lots of examples. Though really the entire book is useful if you do a lot of work with data visualizations of any type. **UChicago authentication required.**

## What you need to do

* Work on [homework 7](hw07-distrib-learn-geospatial.html)
