## Major topics

* Elementary programming techniques (e.g. loops, conditional statements, functions)
* Writing reusable, interpretable code
* Problem-solving - debugging programs for errors
* Obtaining, importing, and munging data from a variety of sources
* Performing statistical analysis
* Visualizing information
* Creating interactive reports
* Generating reproducible research

# load packages
library(tidyverse)

# estimate and print the linear model

                             "P-Value"))

# visualize the relationship

  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE,
              color = "black", alpha = .25) +
  labs(x = "Engine displacement (in liters)",
       y = "Highway miles per gallon",

## Plagiarism

* Collaboration is good -- *to a point*
* Learning from others/the internet

## Plagiarism

> If you don't understand what the program is doing and are not prepared to explain it in detail, you should not submit it.

## Evaluations

* Weekly programming assignments
* Peer review

## {.center}

![](../images/data-science/base.png)

## Program

> A series of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation

* Input
* Output
* Math
* Conditional execution
* Repetition

## Two different approaches

![](../images/data-science/base.png)

* Jane: a GUI workflow
* Sally: a programatic workflow

## Automation

* Jane forgets how she transformed and analyzed the data
    * Extension of analysis will fall flat
* Sally uses *automation*
    * Re-run programs
    * No mistakes
    * Much easier to implement *in the long run*

## Reproducibility

* Are my results valid? Can it be *replicated*?
* The idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them
* Also allows the researcher to precisely replicate his/her analysis

## Version control

* Revisions in research
* Tracking revisions
* Multiple copies
    * `analysis-1.r`
    * `analysis-2.r`
    * `analysis-3.r`
* Cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, Box)
* Version control software
    * Repository

## Documentation

* *Comments* are the what
* *Code* is the how
* Computer code should also be *self-documenting*
* Future-proofing

## Badly documented code

```{r sesame-bad, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)
tmls <- get_timeline(c("MeCookieMonster", "Grover", "elmo", "CountVonCount"), 3000)
ts_plot(group_by(tmls, screen_name), "weeks")
```

## Good code

```{r sesame-good, eval = FALSE}
# get_to_sesame_street.R
# Program to retrieve recent tweets from Sesame Street characters

# load packages for data management and Twitter API
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)

# retrieve most recent 3000 tweets of Sesame Street characters
tmls <- get_timeline(
  user = c("MeCookieMonster", "Grover", "elmo", "CountVonCount"),
  n = 3000
)

# group by character and plot weekly tweet frequency
tmls %>%
  group_by(screen_name) %>%
  ts_plot(by = "weeks")
```

## Good code

```{r sesame-good, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
```
