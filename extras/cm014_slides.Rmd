## Distributed computing

![](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/clouds.jpg)

## SQL

* *Structured Query Language*
* Means of communicating with a relational database management system
* Different flavors of SQL
    * SQLite
    * MySQL
    * Microsoft SQL
    * PostgreSQL
    * BigQuery
* Hosting platforms
    * [UChicago Research Computing Center](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/)
    * [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
    * [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)

## SQL locally

```{r, cache = FALSE}
library(RSQLite)
my_db <- src_sqlite("../data/my_db.sqlite3", create = T)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
flights_sqlite <- copy_to(my_db, flights, temporary = FALSE, indexes = list(
  c("year", "month", "day"), "carrier", "tailnum"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
if(file.exists("my_db.sqlite3")){
  flights_sqlite <- tbl(my_db, "flights")
} else{
  flights_sqlite <- copy_to(my_db, flights, temporary = FALSE, indexes = list(
  c("year", "month", "day"), "carrier", "tailnum"))
}
```

```{r}
flights_sqlite
```

## Basic verbs {.scrollable}

```{r echo = TRUE}
select(flights_sqlite, year:day, dep_delay, arr_delay)
filter(flights_sqlite, dep_delay > 240)
arrange(flights_sqlite, year, month, day)
mutate(flights_sqlite, speed = air_time / distance)
summarise(flights_sqlite, delay = mean(dep_time))
```

## Convert to SQL

```{r, echo = TRUE}
select(flights_sqlite, year:day, dep_delay, arr_delay) %>%
  explain()
```

```sql
SELECT `year` AS `year`, `month` AS `month`, `day` AS `day`, `dep_delay` AS `dep_delay`, `arr_delay` AS `arr_delay`
FROM `flights`
```

## Laziness

```{r}
c1 <- filter(flights_sqlite, year == 2013, month == 1, day == 1)
c2 <- select(c1, year, month, day, carrier, dep_delay, air_time, distance)
c3 <- mutate(c2, speed = distance / air_time * 60)
c4 <- arrange(c3, year, month, day, carrier)
```

## Laziness {.scrollable}

```{r}
c4
```

```{r}
collect(c4)
```

## Google Bigquery

* Can scan TB in seconds and PB in minutes
* Flexible pricing depending on needs
* Could be as little a pennies, though depending on your computation may cost more

## Interacting with Google Bigquery via `dplyr`

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(bigrquery)

taxi <- src_bigquery(project = "nyc-tlc",
                     dataset = "yellow",
                     billing = getOption("bigquery_id"))
taxi
```

## Questions {.scrollable}

How many trips per taken each month in yellow cabs?

```sql
SELECT
  LEFT(STRING(pickup_datetime), 7) month,
  COUNT(*) trips
FROM
  [nyc-tlc:yellow.trips]
WHERE
  YEAR(pickup_datetime) = 2014
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  1
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
system.time({
  trips_by_month <- taxi %>%
    tbl("trips") %>%
    filter(year(pickup_datetime) == 2014) %>%
    mutate(month = month(pickup_datetime)) %>%
    count(month) %>%
    arrange(month) %>%
    collect()
})
trips_by_month
```

## Questions {.scrollable}

What about the average speed per hour of day in yellow cabs?

```{r echo = TRUE}
system.time({
  speed_per_hour <- taxi %>%
    tbl("trips") %>%
    mutate(hour = hour(pickup_datetime),
           trip_duration = (dropoff_datetime - pickup_datetime) / 3600000000) %>%
    mutate(speed = trip_distance / trip_duration) %>%
    filter(fare_amount / trip_distance >= 2,
           fare_amount / trip_distance <= 10) %>%
    group_by(hour) %>%
    summarize(speed = mean(speed)) %>%
    arrange(hour) %>%
    collect()
})

ggplot(speed_per_hour, aes(hour, speed)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average Speed of NYC Yellow Taxis",
       x = "Hour of day",
       y = "Average speed, in MPH")
```

## Questions {.scrollable}

Finally, what is the average speed by day of the week?

```{r echo = TRUE}
system.time({
  speed_per_day <- taxi %>%
    tbl("trips") %>%
    mutate(hour = hour(pickup_datetime),
           day = dayofweek(pickup_datetime),
           trip_duration = (dropoff_datetime - pickup_datetime) / 3600000000) %>%
    mutate(speed = trip_distance / trip_duration) %>%
    filter(fare_amount / trip_distance >= 2,
           fare_amount / trip_distance <= 10,
           hour >= 8,
           hour <= 18) %>%
    group_by(day) %>%
    summarize(speed = mean(speed)) %>%
    arrange(day) %>%
    collect()
})
speed_per_day
```

## Parallel computing

![From [An introduction to parallel programming using Python's multiprocessing module](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_multiprocessing.html)](http://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2014/multiprocessing_intro/multiprocessing_scheme.png)

## Parallel computing

* Parallel processing
* Serial processing
* Multithreading

## Why use parallel computing

* Imitates real life
* More efficient (maybe)
* Tackle larger problems
* Distributed resources

## Why not to use parallel computing

![Amdahl's Law from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/AmdahlsLaw.svg/768px-AmdahlsLaw.svg.png)
    
## Why not to use parallel computing

* Limits to efficiency gains
* Complexity
* Dependencies
* Parallel slowdown
