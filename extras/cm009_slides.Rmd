## Bugs

![Not the kind of bugs we're looking for](../images/bugs.jpg)

## Bugs

* "An error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways."
* Computers are powerful tools that are incredibly stupid
* Debugging has two goals:
    * Fix bugs once they occur
    * Prevent bugs from occurring in the first place

## Defensive programming

* Style guide
* Failing fast

We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
</p>

<p align = "left" style="font-size:25px">
And I want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them....
</p>

<p align = "left" style="font-size:25px">
The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

## File names

```r
# Good
fit-models.R
utility-functions.R
gun-deaths.Rmd

# Bad
foo.r
stuff.r
gun deaths.rmd
```

## Object names

```r
# Good
day_one
day_1

# Bad
first_day_of_the_month
DayOne
dayone
djm1
```

## Overwriting objects

```r
# Bad
T <- FALSE
c <- 10
```

```{r mean}
x <- 1:10
mean(x)
```

```r
# create new mean function
mean <- function(x) sum(x)
mean(x)
```

```
[1] 55
```


## Spacing

```r
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

## Curly braces

```r
# Good

if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("Y is negative")
}

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} else {
  y ^ x
}

# Bad

if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} 
else {
  y ^ x
}
```

It's ok to leave very short statements on the same line:

```r
if (y < 0 && debug) message("Y is negative")
```

## Line length

```r
# Good
scdbv <- scdbv %>%
  mutate(chief = factor(chief,
                        levels = c("Jay", "Rutledge", "Ellsworth",
                                   "Marshall", "Taney", "Chase",
                                   "Waite", "Fuller", "White",
                                   "Taft", "Hughes", "Stone",
                                   "Vinson", "Warren", "Burger",
                                   "Rehnquist", "Roberts")))

# Bad
scdbv <- mutate(scdbv, chief = factor(chief, levels = c("Jay", "Rutledge", "Ellsworth", "Marshall", "Taney", "Chase", "Waite", "Fuller", "White", "Taft", "Hughes", "Stone", "Vinson", "Warren", "Burger", "Rehnquist", "Roberts")))
```

## Indentation

```r
# pure function
long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument", 
                               b = "another argument",
                               c = "another long argument") {
  # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
}

# in a mutate() function
scdbv <- scdbv %>%
  mutate(majority = majority - 1,
         chief = factor(chief,
                        levels = c("Jay", "Rutledge", "Ellsworth",
                                   "Marshall", "Taney", "Chase",
                                   "Waite", "Fuller", "White",
                                   "Taft", "Hughes", "Stone",
                                   "Vinson", "Warren", "Burger",
                                   "Rehnquist", "Roberts")))

## Auto-formatting in RStudio

* **Code > Reformat Code** (Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + A)
* **Code > Reindent Lines** (Cmd/Ctrl + I)

## Exercise: style this code

![](http://cdn-mf0.heartyhosting.com/sites/mensfitness.com/files/_main_yoga.jpg)

## Fatal errors

```{r error, error = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
addition <- function(x, y){
  if(!is_numeric(c(x, y))) stop("One of your inputs is not a number.")
  
  x + y
}

addition(3, "abc")
```

## Warnings

```{r logit, error = TRUE}
logit <- function(x){
  log(x / (1 - x))
}

logit(-1)
```

## Warnings

```{r logit_error, error = TRUE}
logit <- function(x){
 if(x < 0 | x > 1) stop('x not between 0 and 1')
 log(x / (1 - x))
}

logit(-1)
```

## Warnings

```{r logit_warning}
logit <- function(x){
  x <- ifelse(x < 0 | x > 1, NA, x)
  if(is.na(x)) warning('x not between 0 and 1')
  log(x / (1 - x))
}

logit(-1)
```

## Messages

```{r message_ggplot}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

## Suppressing messages

```{r message_print}
demo_message <- function() message("This is a message")
demo_message()
suppressMessages(demo_message())  # no output

demo_print <- function() print("This is a message")
demo_print()
suppressMessages(demo_print())  # still output
```

## Exercise: build a function with conditions

![](https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Yoga-Poses-to-Help-Ankylosing-Spondylitis-09-RM-722x406.jpg)

## The call stack

```{r callstack, error = TRUE}
f <- function(a) g(a)
g <- function(b) h(b)
h <- function(c) i(c)
i <- function(d) "a" + d
f(10)
```

```{r traceback, eval = FALSE}
traceback()
```

```
# 4: i(c) at exceptions-example.R#3
# 3: h(b) at exceptions-example.R#2
# 2: g(a) at exceptions-example.R#1
# 1: f(10)
```

## Condition handling

* Unexpected errors
* Expected errors
* `try()`
* `safely()`

## Ignore errors with `try()`

```{r try_error, error = TRUE}
f1 <- function(x) {
  log(x)
  10
}
f1("x")
```

## Ignore errors with `try()`

```{r try_error_wrap, error = TRUE}
f2 <- function(x) {
  try(log(x))
  10
}
f2("a")
```

## Ignore errors with `try()`

```r
try({
  a <- 1
  b <- "x"
  a + b
})
```

## Dealing with failure using `safely()`

* Adverb
* Always returns a list with two elements
    1. `result`
    1. `error`
* More predictable than `try()`

## Dealing with failure using `safely()`

```{r sqrt_safely}
safe_sqrt <- safely(sqrt)
str(safe_sqrt(9))
str(safe_sqrt("a"))
```

## `safely()` and `map()` {.scrollable}

```{r safely_map, error = TRUE}
x <- list("a", 4, 5)

# unsafely square root
y <- x
  map(sqrt)

# safely log
y <- x %>%
  map(safely(sqrt))
str(y)
```

## `transpose()`

```{r transpose}
y <- y %>%
  transpose()
str(y)
```

## Extract the values of `x` where `y` is an error

```{r error_x}
is_ok <- y$error %>%
  map_lgl(is_null)
x[!is_ok]
```

## Extract the values of `y` that are ok

```{r okay_y}
y$result[is_ok] %>%
  flatten_dbl()
```

## `possibly()`

```{r possibly}
x %>%
  map_dbl(possibly(sqrt, NA))
```

## `quietly()`

```{r quietly}
x <- list(1, -1)
x %>%
  map(quietly(sqrt)) %>%
  str()
```

## Exercise: handle conditions using `safely()`
