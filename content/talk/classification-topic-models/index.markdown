## Overview

* Define topic modeling
* Define a document-term matrix
* Use text as predictors for classification algorithms
* Explain Latent Dirichlet allocation and how this process works
* Demonstrate how to use LDA to recover topic structure from a known set of topics
* Demonstrate how to use LDA to recover topic structure from an unknown set of topics
* Identify methods for selecting the appropriate parameter for `\(k\)`

## Before class

* Read chapters 5-7 in [*Tidy Text Mining with R*](http://tidytextmining.com/)
* Read [Blei, D. M. (2012). Probabilistic topic models. *Communications of the ACM*, 55(4), 77-84.](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/4/147361-probabilistic-topic-models/fulltext)

## Class materials
