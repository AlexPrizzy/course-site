## Overview

* Introduce the major components of a geospatial visualization
* Identify how to draw raster maps using `ggmaps` and `get_map()`
* Define shapefiles and import spatial data using the `sf` package
* Draw maps using `ggplot2` and `geom_sf()`

## Before class

* Read [Introduction to geospatial visualization](/notes/intro-geospatial-viz/)
* Read [Drawing raster maps with `ggmap`](/notes/raster-maps-with-ggmap/)
* Read [Importing shapefiles using `sf`](/notes/simple-features/)
* Read [Drawing vector maps with `ggplot2` and `sf`](/notes/vector-maps/)

## Class materials

* [Practice drawing raster maps](/notes/raster-maps-practice/)
* [Practice drawing vector maps](/notes/vector-maps-practice/)

* [Mapping data in *The Truthful Art* by Alberto Cairo](https://uchicago.ares.atlas-sys.com/ares/ares.dll?SessionID=A103809140M&Action=10&Type=10&Value=696335) - excellent chapter on designing data maps with lots of examples. Though really the entire book is useful if you do a lot of work with data visualizations of any type. **UChicago authentication required.**

## Additional resources

* [Learn Spatial Analysis](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/) - tutorials and workshops conducted by the Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago. Lots of materials developed using R.
