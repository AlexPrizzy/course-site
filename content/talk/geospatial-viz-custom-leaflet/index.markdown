## Overview

* Change coordinate systems
* Generate appropriate color palettes to visualize additional dimensions of data
* Introduce interactive maps and the `leaflet` package

## Before class

* Read [Drawing vector maps with `ggplot2` and `sf`](/notes/vector-maps/)
* Read [Selecting optimal color palettes](/notes/optimal-color-palettes/)
* Read [Drawing interactive maps with `leaflet`](/notes/leaflet)

## Class materials

* [Practice drawing vector maps](/notes/vector-maps-practice/)

* [Mapping data in *The Truthful Art* by Alberto Cairo](http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/databases-and-reporting-tools/9780133440492/part-iii-functional/ch10_html) - excellent chapter on designing data maps with lots of examples. Though really the entire book is useful if you do a lot of work with data visualizations of any type. **UChicago authentication required.**

## What you need to do

* Work on [homework 8](/homework/geospatial-viz/)
