# Resampling methods

Resampling methods are essential to test and evaluate statistical models. Because you likely do not have the resources or capabilities to repeatedly sample from your population of interest, instead you can repeatedly draw from your original sample to obtain additional information about your model. For instance, you could repeatedly draw samples from your data, estimate a linear regression model on each sample, and then examine how the estimated model differs across each sample. This allows you to assess the variability and stability of your model in a way not possible if you can only fit the model once.

# Validation set

We have already seen the **validation set** approach in the [previous class](stat003_logistic_regression.html). By splitting our data into a **training set** and **test set**, we can evaluate the model's effectiveness at predicting the response variable (in the context of either regression or classification) independently of the data used to estimate the model in the first place.

## Classification

Recall how we used this approach to evaluate the accuracy of our [interactive model predicting survival during the sinking of the Titanic](stat003_logistic_regression.html#interactive_terms).

```{r titanic_data, message = FALSE}
library(titanic)
titanic <- titanic_train %>%
  as_tibble()

titanic %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r age_woman_cross}
survive_age_woman_x <- glm(Survived ~ Age * Sex, data = titanic,
                           family = binomial)
summary(survive_age_woman_x)
```

```{r logit}
logit2prob <- function(x){
  exp(x) / (1 + exp(x))
}
```

```{r accuracy_age_gender_x_test_set, dependson="age_woman_cross", message = FALSE}
library(modelr)

titanic_split <- resample_partition(titanic, c(test = 0.3, train = 0.7))
map(titanic_split, dim)

train_model <- glm(Survived ~ Age + Sex, data = titanic_split$train,
                   family = binomial)
summary(train_model)

x_test_accuracy <- titanic_split$test %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  add_predictions(train_model) %>%
  mutate(pred = logit2prob(pred),
         pred = as.numeric(pred > .5))

mean(x_test_accuracy$Survived == x_test_accuracy$pred, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Regression

This method also works for regression analysis. Here we will examine the relationship between horsepower and car mileage in the `Auto` dataset (found in `library(ISLR)`):

```{r auto}
library(ISLR)

Auto <- Auto %>%
  tbl_df()
Auto
```

```{r auto_plot, dependson="auto"}
ggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower, mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

The relationship does not appear to be strictly linear:

```{r auto_plot_lm, dependson="auto"}
ggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Perhaps by adding [quadratic terms](stat003_logistic_regression.html#quadratic_terms) to the linear regression we could improve overall model fit. To evaluate the model, we will split the data into a training set and test set, estimate a series of higher-order models, and calculate a test statistic summarizing the accuracy of the estimated `mpg`. Rather than relying on the raw error rate (which makes sense in a classification model), we will instead use **Mean Squared Error** (MSE), defined as

$$MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(y_i - \hat{f}(x_i))^2}$$

where:

* $y_i =$ the observed response value for the $i$th observation
* $\hat{f}(x_i) =$ the predicted response value for the $i$th observation given by $\hat{f}$
* $n =$ the total number of observations

Boo math! Actually this is pretty intuitive. All we're doing is for each observation, calculating the difference between the actual and predicted values for $y$, squaring that difference, then calculating the average across all observations. An MSE of 0 indicates the model perfectly predicted each observation. The larger the MSE, the more error in the model.

For this task, first we can use `modelr::resample_partition()` to create training and test sets (using a 50/50 split), then estimate a linear regression model without any quadratic terms.

* I use `set.seed()` in the beginning - whenever you are writing a script that involves randomization (here, random subsetting of the data), always set the seed at the beginning of the script. This ensures the results can be reproduced precisely.^[The actual value you use is irrelevant. Just be sure to set it in the script, otherwise R will randomly pick one each time you start a new session.]
* I also use the `glm()` function rather than `lm()` - if you don't change the `family` parameter, the results of `lm()` and `glm()` are exactly the same.^[The default `family` for `glm()` is `gaussian()`, or the **Gaussian** distribution. You probably know it by its other name, the [**Normal** distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).]

```{r auto_split}
set.seed(1234)

auto_split <- resample_partition(Auto, c(test = 0.5, train = 0.5))
auto_train <- auto_split$train %>%
  tbl_df()
auto_test <- auto_split$test %>%
  tbl_df()
```

```{r auto_lm, dependson="auto_split"}
auto_lm <- glm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = auto_train)
summary(auto_lm)
```

To estimate the MSE for a single partition (i.e. for a training or test set), I wrote a special function `mse()`:^[This function can also be loaded via the [`rcfss`](https://github.com/uc-cfss/rcfss) library. Be sure to update your package to the latest version to make sure the function is available.]

```{r mse-function}
mse <- function(model, data) {
  x <- modelr:::residuals(model, data)
  mean(x ^ 2, na.rm = TRUE)
}
```

```{r mse, dependson="auto_split"}
mse(auto_lm, auto_test)
```

For a strictly linear model, the MSE for the test set is `r formatC(mse(auto_lm, auto_test), digits = 4)`. How does this compare to a quadratic model? We can use the `poly()` function in conjunction with a `map()` iteration to estimate the MSE for a series of models with higher-order polynomial terms:

```{r mse_poly, dependson="auto_split"}
auto_poly_glm <- function(x){
  glm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, x), data = auto_train)
}

auto_poly_results <- data_frame(terms = 1:5,
                                model = map(terms, auto_poly_glm),
                                MSE = map_dbl(model,
                                              mse,
                                              data = auto_test)
)

ggplot(auto_poly_results, aes(terms, MSE)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Comparing quadratic linear models",
       subtitle = "Using validation set",
       x = "Highest-order polynomial",
       y = "Mean Squared Error")
```

Based on the MSE for the validation (test) set, a polynomial model with a quadratic term ($\text{horsepower}^2$) produces the lowest average error. Adding cubic or higher-order terms is just not necessary.

## Drawbacks to validation sets

There are two main problems with validation sets:

1. Validation estimates of the test error rates can be highly variable depending on which observations are sampled into the training and test sets. See what happens if we repeat the sampling, estimation, and validation procedure for the `Auto` data set:

    ```{r auto_variable_mse}
    mse_variable <- function(Auto){
      auto_split <- resample_partition(Auto, c(test = 0.5, train = 0.5))
      auto_train <- auto_split$train %>%
        tbl_df()
      auto_test <- auto_split$test %>%
        tbl_df()
      
      results <- data_frame(terms = 1:5,
                            model = map(terms, auto_poly_glm),
                            MSE = map_dbl(model, mse, data = auto_test))
      
      return(results)
    }
    
    rerun(10, mse_variable(Auto)) %>%
      bind_rows(.id = "id") %>%
      ggplot(aes(terms, MSE, color = id)) +
      geom_line() +
      labs(title = "Variability of MSE estimates",
           subtitle = "Using the validation set approach",
           x = "Degree of Polynomial",
           y = "Mean Squared Error") +
      theme(legend.position = "none")
    ```
    
    Depending on the specific training/test split, our MSE varies by up to 5.

1. If you don't have a large data set, you'll have to dramatically shrink the size of your training set. Most statistical learning methods perform better with more observations - if you don't have enough data in the training set, you might overestimate the error rate in the test set.

# Leave-one-out cross-validation

An alternative method is **leave-one-out cross validation** (LOOCV). Like with the validation set approach, you split the data into two parts. However the difference is that you only remove one observation for the test set, and keep all remaining observations in the training set. The statistical learning method is fit on the $n-1$ training set. You then use the held-out observation to calculate the $MSE = (y_1 - \hat{y}_1)^2$ which should be an unbiased estimator of the test error. Because this MSE is highly dependent on which observation is held out, **we repeat this process for every single observation in the data set**. Mathematically, this looks like:

$$CV_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{MSE_i}$$

This method produces estimates of the error rate that have minimal bias and are relatively steady (i.e. non-varying), unlike the validation set approach where the MSE estimate is highly dependent on the sampling process for training/test sets. LOOCV is also highly flexible and works with any kind of predictive modeling.

Of course the downside is that this method is computationally difficult. You have to estimate $n$ different models - if you have a large $n$ or each individual model takes a long time to compute, you may be stuck waiting a long time for the computer to finish its calculations.

## LOOCV in linear regression

We can use the `crossv_kfold()` function in the `modelr` library to compute the LOOCV of any linear or logistic regression model. It takes two arguments: the data frame and the number of $k$-folds (which we will define shortly). For our purposes now, all you need to know is that `k` should equal the number of observations in the data frame which we can retrieve using the `nrow()` function. For the `Auto` dataset, this looks like:

```{r loocv-data, dependson="Auto"}
loocv_data <- crossv_kfold(Auto, k = nrow(Auto))
```

Now we estimate the linear model $k$ times, excluding the holdout test observation, then calculate the MSE:

```{r loocv, dependson="Auto"}
loocv_models <- map(loocv_data$train, ~ lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = .))
loocv_mse <- map2_dbl(loocv_models, loocv_data$test, mse)
mean(loocv_mse)
```

The results of the mapped `mse()` function is the MSE for each iteration through the data, so there is one MSE for each observation. Calculating the `mean()` of that vector gives us the LOOCV MSE.

We can also use this method to compare the optimal number of polynomial terms as before.

```{r loocv_poly, dependson="Auto"}
cv_error <- vector("numeric", 5)
terms <- 1:5

for(i in terms){
  loocv_models <- map(loocv_data$train, ~ lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i),
                                             data = .)
  )
  loocv_mse <- map2_dbl(loocv_models, loocv_data$test, mse)
  cv_error[[i]] <- mean(loocv_mse)
}

cv_mse <- data_frame(terms = terms,
                     cv_MSE = cv_error)
cv_mse

ggplot(cv_mse, aes(terms, cv_MSE)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Comparing quadratic linear models",
       subtitle = "Using LOOCV",
       x = "Highest-order polynomial",
       y = "Mean Squared Error")
```

And arrive at a similar conclusion. There may be a very marginal advantage to adding a fifth-order polynomial, but not substantial enough for the additional complexity over a mere second-order polynomial.

## LOOCV in classification

Let's use classification to validate the interactive terms model from before. For technical reasons, we need to use a custom `mse.glm()` function to properly calculate the MSE for binary response variables:^[This function can also be loaded via the [`rcfss`](https://github.com/uc-cfss/rcfss) library.]

```{r mse-glm}
mse.glm <- function (model, data){
  residuals.glm <- function(model, data) {
    modelr:::response(model, data) - stats::predict(model,
                                                    data,
                                                    type = "response")
  }
  
  x <- residuals(model, data)
  mean(x^2, na.rm = TRUE)
}
```

```{r titanic_loocv}
titanic_loocv <- crossv_kfold(titanic, k = nrow(titanic))
titanic_models <- map(titanic_loocv$train, ~ glm(Survived ~ Age * Sex,
                                                 data = .,
                                                 family = binomial))
titanic_mse <- map2_dbl(titanic_models, titanic_loocv$test, mse.glm)
mean(titanic_mse, na.rm = TRUE)
```

In a classification problem, the LOOCV tells us the average error rate based on our predictions. So here, it tells us that the interactive `Age * Sex` model has a `r formatC(mean(titanic_mse, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 3)`% error rate, or `r formatC((1 - mean(titanic_mse, na.rm = TRUE)) * 100, digits = 3)`%. This is similar to the validation set result ($`r formatC(mean(x_test_accuracy$Survived == x_test_accuracy$pred, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 3)`\%$)

## Exercise: LOOCV in linear regression

      mutate(model = map(train, ~ glm(vote96 ~ mhealth, data = .,
                                      family = binomial)),
             mse = map2_dbl(model, test, mse.glm))
    mean(mh_loocv_lite$mse, na.rm = TRUE)
    
    # full model
    mh_loocv_full <- crossv_kfold(mental_health, k = nrow(mental_health)) %>%
      mutate(model = map(train, ~ glm(vote96 ~ ., data = .,
                                      family = binomial)),
             mse = map2_dbl(model, test, mse.glm))
    mean(mh_loocv_full$mse, na.rm = TRUE)
    ```
    
    The full model is better and has a lower error rate.
    
      </p>
    </details>

# k-fold cross-validation

A less computationally-intensive approach to cross validation is **$k$-fold cross-validation**. Rather than dividing the data into $n$ groups, one divides the observations into $k$ groups, or **folds**, of approximately equal size. The first fold is treated as the validation set, and the model is estimated on the remaining $k-1$ folds. This process is repeated $k$ times, with each fold serving as the validation set precisely once. The $k$-fold CV estimate is calculated by averaging the MSE values for each fold:

$$CV_{(k)} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i = 1}^{k}{MSE_i}$$

As you probably figured out by now, LOOCV is the special case of $k$-fold cross-validation where $k = n$. More typically researchers will use $k=5$ or $k=10$ depending on the size of the data set and the complexity of the statistical model.

## k-fold CV in linear regression

Let's go back to the `Auto` data set. Instead of LOOCV, let's use 10-fold CV to compare the different polynomial models.

```{r 10_fold_auto}
cv10_data <- crossv_kfold(Auto, k = 10)

cv_error_fold10 <- vector("numeric", 5)
terms <- 1:5

for(i in terms){
  cv10_models <- map(cv10_data$train, ~ lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i),
                                           data = .)
  )
  cv10_mse <- map2_dbl(cv10_models, cv10_data$test, mse)
  cv_error_fold10[[i]] <- mean(cv10_mse)
}

cv_error_fold10
```

How do these results compare to the LOOCV values?

```{r 10_fold_auto_loocv, dependson=c("10_fold_auto","loocv_poly")}
data_frame(terms = terms,
           loocv = cv_error,
           fold10 = cv_error_fold10) %>%
  gather(method, MSE, loocv:fold10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(terms, MSE, color = method)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "MSE estimates",
       x = "Degree of Polynomial",
       y = "Mean Squared Error",
       color = "CV Method")
```

Pretty much the same results.

## Computational speed of LOOCV vs. $k$-fold CV

### LOOCV

```{r loocv_time}
library(profvis)

profvis({
  cv_error <- vector("numeric", 5)
  terms <- 1:5
  
  for(i in terms){
    loocv_models <- map(loocv_data$train, ~ lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), data = .))
    loocv_mse <- map2_dbl(loocv_models, loocv_data$test, mse)
    cv_error[[i]] <- mean(loocv_mse)
  }
})
```

### 10-fold CV

```{r kfold_time}
profvis({
  cv_error_fold10 <- vector("numeric", 5)
  terms <- 1:5
  
  for(i in terms){
    cv10_models <- map(cv10_data$train, ~ lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), data = .))
    cv10_mse <- map2_dbl(cv10_models, cv10_data$test, mse)
    cv_error_fold10[[i]] <- mean(cv10_mse)
  }
})
```

On my machine, 10-fold CV was about 40 times faster than LOOCV. Again, estimating $k=10$ models is going to be much easier than estimating $k=`r nrow(Auto)`$ models.

## k-fold CV in logistic regression

You've gotten the idea by now, but let's do it one more time on our interactive Titanic model.

```{r titanic_kfold}
titanic_kfold <- crossv_kfold(titanic, k = 10)
titanic_models <- map(titanic_kfold$train, ~ glm(Survived ~ Age * Sex,
                                                 data = .,
                                                 family = binomial))
titanic_mse <- map2_dbl(titanic_models, titanic_kfold$test, mse.glm)
mean(titanic_mse, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Not a large difference from the LOOCV approach, but it take much less time to compute.

# The bootstrap

The **bootstrap** is a different resampling-based method for quantifying uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical method. It is extremely flexible and can be applied to virtually any statistical method.

## Sampling with replacement

Sampling with replacement allows us to potentially draw the same observation multiple times, and ignore other observations entirely.

```{r sim-sample-replace}
rerun(10, sample.int(10, replace = TRUE)) %>%
  unlist %>%
  matrix(ncol = 10, byrow = TRUE)
```

Here I've drawn 10 random samples with replacement from the vector $`r 1:10`$. Each row contains a different sample. Notice how some rows contain multiples of the same values and exclude others entirely. Compare this to **sampling without replacement**:

```{r sim-sample-noreplace}
rerun(10, sample.int(10, replace = FALSE)) %>%
  unlist %>%
  matrix(ncol = 10, byrow = TRUE)
```

Sampling without replacement doesn't allow you to draw an observation more than once and would produce the exact same sample every time, just in a different order.

## Why use the bootstrap?

Statistical learning methods are frequently used to draw inferences about a population. Since you cannot directly measure the entire population^[Exception - [the Census](http://www.census.gov/2010census/).], you take a sample and ask a question of it instead. But how do you know your sample answer is close to the population answer? There are two approaches you can take:

1. Make **assumptions** about the shape of the population.
1. Use the **information in the sample** to learn about it.

Suppose you decide to make assumptions, e.g. that the sample is distributed normally or [Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution) or some other probability distribution. You could learn about how much the answer to your question varies based on the specific sample drawn by repeatedly generating samples of the same size and asking them the same question. If you have a computaionally convenient assumption (such as the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)), you may even be able to bypass the resampling step and use a known formula to estimate your confidence in the original answer.

Provided you are happy to make the assumptions, this seems like a good idea. If you are not willing to make the assumption, you could instead take the sample you have and sample from it. You can do this because the sample you have **is also a population**, just a very small and discrete one. It is identical to the histogram of your data. Sampling with replacement merely allows you to treat the sample like it's a population and sample from it in a way that reflects its shape.

This is a reasonable thing to do for a couple reasons. First, it's the only information you have about the population. Second, randomly chosen samples should look quite similar to the population from which they came, so as long as you drew a random sample it is likely that your's is also similar.

### Estimating the accuracy of a statistic of interest

Suppose you want to know how often Americans eat ice cream in a given month.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Rockyroadicecream.jpg/800px-Rockyroadicecream.jpg)

We decide to estimate this by tracking a sample of 1000 Americans and counting how many times they eat ice cream over the course of a month.

```{r ice-sim}
# simulate the sample
set.seed(1234)
lambda <- 5
n_obs <- 1000
ice <- data_frame(sim = rpois(n_obs, lambda = lambda))

ggplot(ice, aes(sim)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

The mean of this sample is `r mean(ice$sim)`, which we will treat as the population mean $\mu$. Remember that in the real world, we do not know $\mu$ because we have not observed all members of the population. Instead, we use the sample to estimate $\hat{\mu}$ on the assumption that the sample mean approximates the true mean.

The [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) is the most likely population distribution as it describes the count of events over time. The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is

$$P(k) = \frac{\lambda^{k} e^{-k}}{k!}$$

where $\lambda$ is the event rate (average number of events per interval), $e$ is Euler's number, $k$ is an integer with range $[0, \infty]$, and $k!$ is the factorial of $k$. The mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$ of a Poisson distribution is defined as $\lambda$.

Because we are estimating $\mu$ from a sample, we should also estimate the **standard error** of the sample mean. This is necessary because any random sample drawn from a population will not exactly reproduce the population. We need to account for sampling error by estimating how much our sample mean $\hat{\mu}$ might differ from the true mean $\mu$.

The distribution of the mean of a set of samples is approximately [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).^[As defined by the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem).] Therefore the standard error of the sample mean from a Poisson distribution is

$$\sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{n}}$$

```{r ice-samp-mean}
lambda_samp <- mean(ice$sim)

(sem <- sqrt(lambda_samp / n_obs))
```

The standard error of the sample mean is $`r sem`$. This is a good estimate **as long as the data generating process actually followed a Poisson distribution**. The Poisson distribution requires [several assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Assumptions:_When_is_the_Poisson_distribution_an_appropriate_model.3F). If any of these assumptions are violated, then the formula for estimating the standard error of the sample mean $\lambda$ will not be accurate.

In that situation, we can use the bootstrap to estimate the standard error without making any distributional assumptions. In this approach, we draw $B$ samples with replacement from the original sample. To estimate the population mean $\mu$ we calculate the mean of the bootstrapped sample means $\hat{\mu}_1, \hat{\mu}_2, \dots, \hat{\mu}_B$. To estimate the standard error of the sampling mean $\hat{\mu}$ we use the formula

$$SE_{B}(\hat{\mu}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{r = 1}^{B} \left( \hat{\mu}_r - \frac{1}{B} \sum_{r' = 1}^{B} \hat{\mu}_{r'} \right)^2}$$

What this boils down to is calculating the **standard deviation** of all the bootstrapped sample means. That gives us our standard error.

Let's bootstrap our standard error of the mean for our simulated ice cream data. We'll use $B = 1000$ to produce 1000 bootstrapped estimates of the mean, then calculate the standard deviation of them:

```{r ice-boot}
ice_boot <- ice %>%
  modelr::bootstrap(1000) %>%
  mutate(mean = map_dbl(strap, ~ mean(as_tibble(.)$sim, na.rm = TRUE)))
boot_sem <- sd(ice_boot$mean)
```

```{r ice-boot-plot}
ggplot(ice_boot, aes(mean)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .01) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lambda,
                 color = "Population mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lambda_samp,
                 color = "Sample mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice_boot$mean),
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice_boot$mean) + 1.96 * boot_sem,
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice_boot$mean) - 1.96 * boot_sem,
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lambda_samp + 1.96 * sem,
                 color = "Sample mean"),
             linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lambda_samp - 1.96 * sem,
                 color = "Sample mean"),
             linetype = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(name = NULL, breaks = c("Population mean",
                                             "Sample mean",
                                             "Bootstrapped mean"),
                     values = c("blue", "green", "orange")) +
  labs(x = "Bootstrapped sample mean",
       y = "Count")
```

The bootstrap estimate of the standard error of the sample mean is `r boot_sem`. Compared to the original estimate of `r sem`, this is slightly closer to the defined population mean, but not by much. Why bother using the bootstrap? Because the bootstrap estimator will be more accurate **when the distributional assumptions are not met**.

Let's simulate the results once again, but draw the observations from a combination of the Poisson distribution and [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)).

```{r ice-sim2}
# simulate the sample
set.seed(113)
ice2 <- data_frame(sim = c(rpois(n_obs / 2, lambda = lambda),
                           round(runif(n_obs / 2, min = 0, max = 10))))

# plot the sample distribution
ggplot(ice2, aes(sim)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

# calculate sample mean and standard error
lambda2_samp <- mean(ice2$sim)
sem2 <- sqrt(lambda2_samp / n_obs)

# calculate the bootstrap
ice2_boot <- ice2 %>%
  modelr::bootstrap(1000) %>%
  mutate(mean = map_dbl(strap, ~ mean(as_tibble(.)$sim, na.rm = TRUE)))
boot2_sem <- sd(ice2_boot$mean)

# plot the bootstrapped distribution
ggplot(ice2_boot, aes(mean)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .01) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lambda,
                 color = "Population mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lambda2_samp,
                 color = "Sample mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice2_boot$mean),
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice2_boot$mean) + 1.96 * boot2_sem,
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(ice2_boot$mean) - 1.96 * boot2_sem,
                 color = "Bootstrapped mean"), linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lambda2_samp + 1.96 * sem2,
                 color = "Sample mean"),
             linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lambda2_samp - 1.96 * sem2,
                 color = "Sample mean"),
             linetype = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(name = NULL, breaks = c("Population mean",
                                             "Sample mean",
                                             "Bootstrapped mean"),
                     values = c("blue", "green", "orange")) +
  labs(x = "Bootstrapped sample mean",
       y = "Count")
```

The population mean $\mu$ is still defined as 5, but now look what happens to the standard errors of the estimates. The estimated means are identical under the formula-based or bootstrapped approaches (`r lambda2_samp`), however the standard error for the sample-based approach is $`r sem2`$, compared to `r boot2_sem`. Because the bootstrap approach generates its estimate of the standard error directly from the data, the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval includes the population mean. However the 95% confidence interval under the formula-based method does not include the population mean. In this case we are better off using the bootstrapped standard error rather than using the formula for the Poisson distribution.

### Estimating the accuracy of a linear regression model

In a linear regression model, the standard errors are statistical estimates of the average amount that the estimated parameters $\hat{\beta}$ differ from the true population parameters $\beta$. The formula for estimating standard errors for a linear regression model is:

$$\widehat{s.e.}(\mathbf{\hat{\beta}}_j) = \sqrt{\sigma^{2} (\mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}_{jj}}$$

More simply this is the square root of the diagonal of the [variance-covariance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares#Finite_sample_properties). For the formula to hold, we make certain assumptions, including that our estimate of the variance $\sigma^2$ is accurate and that any variability in the model after we account for $\mathbf{X}$ is the result of the errors $\epsilon$. If these assumptions are wrong, then our estimates of the standard errors will also be wrong.

Let's revisit our horsepower and highway mileage linear model.

```{r auto-boot}
# plot the data and model
ggplot(Auto, aes(horsepower, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# traditional parameter estimates and standard errors
auto_lm <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)
tidy(auto_lm)

# bootstrapped estimates of the parameter estimates and standard errors
auto_boot <- Auto %>%
  modelr::bootstrap(1000) %>%
  mutate(model = map(strap, ~ lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = .)),
         coef = map(model, tidy))

auto_boot %>%
  unnest(coef) %>%
  group_by(term) %>%
  summarize(est.boot = mean(estimate),
            se.boot = sd(estimate, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The bootstrapped estimates of parameters are virtually identical, however the standard errors on the bootstrap estimates are slightly larger. This is because they do not rely on any distributional assumptions, whereas the traditional estimates do. Recall from the [demonstration above](#regression) that the relationship between horsepower and mpg is non-linear, so the residuals from a linear model will be inflated, and the residuals are used to estimate $\sigma^2$. The bootstrap method is not biased by these assumptions and gives us a more robust estimate.

If we compare the traditional and bootstrap estimates for the polynomial regression model, we find more similarity in our results:

```{r auto-boot-sq}
# traditional parameter estimates and standard errors
auto2_lm <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), data = Auto)
tidy(auto2_lm)

# bootstrapped estimates of the parameter estimates and standard errors
auto2_boot <- Auto %>%
  modelr::bootstrap(1000) %>%
  mutate(model = map(strap, ~ lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2),
                                 data = .)),
         coef = map(model, tidy))

auto2_boot %>%
  unnest(coef) %>%
  group_by(term) %>%
  summarize(est.boot = mean(estimate),
            se.boot = sd(estimate, na.rm = TRUE))
```
