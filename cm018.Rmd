## Overview

* Define topic modeling
* Define a document-term matrix
* Use text as predictors for classification algorithms
* Explain Latent Dirichlet allocation and how this process works
* Demonstrate how to use LDA to recover topic structure from a known set of topics
* Demonstrate how to use LDA to recover topic structure from an unknown set of topics
