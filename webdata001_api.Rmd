# Methods for obtaining data online

There are many ways to obtain data from the Internet. Four major categories are:

* **click-and-download** on the internet as a "flat" file, such as .csv, .xls
* **install-and-play** an API for which someone has written a handy R package
* **API-query** published with an unwrapped API
* **Scraping** implicit in an html website

## Click-and-Download

In the simplest case, the data you need is already on the internet in a tabular format. There are a couple of strategies here:

* Use `read.csv` or `readr::read_csv` to read the data straight into R
* Use the `downloader` package or `curl` from the shell to download the file and store a local copy, then use `read_csv` or something similar to read the data into R
    * Even if the file disappears from the internet, you have a local copy cached

Even in this instance, files may need cleaning and transformation when you bring them into R.

## Data supplied on the web

Many times, the data that you want is not already organized into one or a few tables that you can read directly into R. More frequently, you find this data is given in the form of an API. **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterfaces (APIs) are descriptions of the kind of requests that can be made of a certain piece of software, and descriptions of the kind of answers that are returned. Many sources of data - databases, websites, services - have made all (or part) of their data available via APIs over the internet. Computer programs ("clients") can make requests of the server, and the server will respond by sending data (or an error message). This client can be many kinds of other programs or websites, including R running from your laptop.

## Install and play packages

Many common web services and APIs have been "wrapped", i.e. R functions have been written around them which send your query to the server and format the response.

Why do we want this?

* provenance
* reproducible
* updating
* ease
* scaling

# Sightings of birds: `rebird`

[`rebird`](https://github.com/ropensci/rebird) is an R interface for the [ebird](http://ebird.org/content/ebird/) database. e-Bird lets birders upload sightings of birds, and allows everyone access to those data.

```{r rebird-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rebird")
```

```{r rebird, message = FALSE}
library(rebird)
```

## Search birds by geography

The ebird website categorizes some popular locations as "Hotspots". These are areas where there are both lots of birds and lots of birders. Once such location is at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago. You can see data for this site at [http://ebird.org/ebird/hotspot/L1573785](http://ebird.org/ebird/hotspot/L1573785)

At that link, you can see a page like this:

![Lincoln Park Zoo](images/lincoln_park_zoo.png)

The data already look to be organized in a data frame! `rebird` allows us to read these data directly into R.

> The ID code for Lincoln Park Zoo is **L1573785**

```{r rebird-lincoln-park}
ebirdhotspot(locID = "L1573785") %>%
  as_tibble()
```

We can use the function `ebirdgeo` to get a list for an area. (Note that South and West are negative):

```{r rebird-location}
chibirds <- ebirdgeo(lat = 41.8781, lng = -87.6298)
chibirds %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  str()
```

**Note**: Check the defaults on this function. e.g. radius of circle, time of year.

We can also search by "region", which refers to short codes which serve as common shorthands for different political units. For example, France is represented by the letters **FR**

```{r rebird-france}
frenchbirds <- ebirdregion("FR")

frenchbirds %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  str()
```

Find out *WHEN* a bird has been seen in a certain place! Choosing a name from `chibirds` above (the Bald Eagle):

```{r rebird-warbler}
warbler <- ebirdgeo(species = 'Setophaga coronata', lat = 41.8781, lng = -87.6298)

warbler %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  str()
```

`rebird` **knows where you are**:

```{r rebird-where-am-i}
ebirdgeo(species = 'Setophaga coronata') %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

# Searching geographic info: `geonames`

```{r geonames, message = FALSE}
# install.packages(geonames)
library(geonames)
```

## API authentication

Many APIs require you to register for access. This allows them to track which users are submitting queries and manage demand - if you submit too many queries too quickly, you might be **rate-limited** and your requests de-prioritized or blocked. Always check the API access policy of the web site to determine what these limits are.

There are a few things we need to do to be able to use this package to access the geonames API:

1. go to [the geonames site](http://www.geonames.org/login/) and register an account. 
2. click [here to enable the free web service](http://www.geonames.org/enablefreewebservice)
3. Tell R your geonames username and the URL for the API. You could run the line

``` r 
options(geonamesUsername = "my_user_name")
options(geonamesHost = "api.geonames.org")
``` 

in R. However this is insecure. We don't want to risk committing this line and pushing it to our public GitHub page! Instead, you should create a file in the same place as your `.Rproj` file. Name this file `.Rprofile`, and add 

``` r 
options(geonamesUsername = "my_user_name")
options(geonamesHost = "api.geonames.org")
``` 

to that file.

### Important

* Make sure your `.Rprofile` ends with a blank line
* Make sure `.Rprofile` is included in your `.gitignore` file, otherwise it will be synced with Github
* Restart RStudio after modifying `.Rprofile` in order to load any new keys into memory
* Spelling is important when you set the option in your `.Rprofile`
* You can do a similar process for an arbitrary package or key. For example:

```{r rprofile, eval = FALSE}
# in .Rprofile
options("this_is_my_key" = XXXX)

# later, in the R script:
key <- getOption("this_is_my_key")
```

This is a simple means to keep your keys private, especially if you are sharing the same authentication across several projects. Remember that using `.Rprofile` makes your code un-reproducible. In this case, that is exactly what we want!

## Using Geonames

What can we do? Get access to lots of geographical information via the various ["web services"](http://www.geonames.org/export/ws-overview.html)

```{r geonames-country-info}
countryInfo <- GNcountryInfo()
```

```{r geonames-str}
countryInfo %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  str()
```

This country info dataset is very helpful for accessing the rest of the data, because it gives us the standardized codes for country and language.  

# The Manifesto Project: `manifestoR`

[The Manifesto Project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/) collects and organizes political party manifestos from around the world. It currently covers over 1000 parties from 1945 until today in over 50 countries on five continents. We can use the [`manifestoR` package](https://github.com/ManifestoProject/manifestoR) to access the API and download those manifestos for analysis in R.

## Load library and set API key

Accessing data from the Manifesto Project API requires an authentication key. You can create an account and key [here](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/signup). Here I store my key in `.Rprofile` and retrieve it using `mp_setapikey()`.

```{r manifestor-load, message = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
library(manifestoR)

# retrieve API key stored in .Rprofile
mp_setapikey(key = getOption("manifesto_key"))
```

## Retrieve the database

```{r manifestor-db}
(mpds <- mp_maindataset())
```

`mp_maindataset()` includes a data frame describing each manifesto included in the database. You can use this database for some exploratory data analysis. For instance, how many manifestos have been published by each political party in Sweden?

```{r manifesto-dist}
mpds %>%
  filter(countryname == "Sweden") %>%
  count(partyname) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(partyname, n), n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Political manifestos published in Sweden",
       x = NULL,
       y = "Total (1948-present)") +
  coord_flip()
```

Or we can use **scaling functions** to identify each party manifesto on an ideological dimension. For example, how have the Democratic and Republican Party manifestos in the United States changed over time?

```{r manifestor-usa}
mpds %>%
  filter(party == 61320 | party == 61620) %>%
  mutate(ideo = mp_scale(.)) %>%
  select(partyname, edate, ideo) %>%
  ggplot(aes(edate, ideo, color = partyname)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +
  labs(title = "Ideological scaling of major US political parties",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Ideological position",
       color = NULL) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Download manifestos

`mp_corpus()` can be used to download the original manifestos as full text documents stored as a [**corpus**](text001_tidytext.html#extract_documents_and_move_into_a_corpus). Once you obtain the corpus, you can perform [text](cm017.html) [analysis](cm018.html). As an example, let's compare the most common words in the Democratic and Republican Party manifestos from the 2012 U.S. presidential election:

```{r manifestor-corpus, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# download documents
(docs <- mp_corpus(countryname == "United States" & edate > as.Date("2012-01-01")))

# generate wordcloud of most common terms
docs %>%
  tidy() %>%
  mutate(party = factor(party, levels = c(61320, 61620),
                        labels = c("Democratic Party", "Republican Party"))) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(party, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  reshape2::acast(word ~ party, value.var = "n", fill = 0) %>%
  comparison.cloud(max.words = 200)
```

# Acknowledgments {.toc-ignore}

```{r child='_ack_stat545.Rmd'}
```

# Session Info {.toc-ignore}

```{r child='_sessioninfo.Rmd'}
```
