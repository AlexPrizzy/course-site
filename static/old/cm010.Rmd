# cm010 - October 31, 2018

## Overview

* Review the importance of reproducibility in scientific research
* Identify the major components of R Markdown
* Implement chunk options to customize output
* Incorporate in-line R code in R Markdown documents
* Introduce the different R Markdown formats
* Identify common problems with Git and explain how to resolve these problems

## Before class

* Read chapters 27-29 in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) for more on R Markdown and document formats
* Review [chapter 6](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html) in *R for Data Science* for more info on scripts
* Read [Recovering from Git Predicaments](git_more.html) - some important tips for fixing problems related to Git

## Slides and links

* [Slides](extras/cm010_slides.html)
* [A dive into R Markdown](program_rmarkdown.html)

* [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) - the official site for R Markdown. Lots of great explanations of the different formats and options available for each one.
* [`flexdashboard`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) - documentation for `flexdashboard` to create information dashboards using R Markdown
* [`pipeline-example`](https://github.com/uc-cfss/pipeline-example) - a repo demonstrating how to combine and use R scripts and R Markdown documents. I recommend you fork/clone the repo to your computer, then explore and execute the different files to see how everything works together.

## What you need to do

* [Start homework 5](hw05-reproducible-research.html)
* Install the `titanic` package using the command `install.packages("titanic")`. We will be using this package in-class next time
